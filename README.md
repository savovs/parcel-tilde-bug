# Parcel Tilde Bug

Parcel docs say you should be able to use a tilde `~` in your paths to refer to the root of the package root, i.e. the root folder of your project. That doesn't seem to work.

This repo provides a minimal reproduction of this case in the form a very common structure used by server-rendered React apps.
